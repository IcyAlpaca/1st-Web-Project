      <h3><u>Learn More About The Inn!</u></h3>
      <p class="solid">Takoya's Inn has been around for many generations. Legends say that the inn was built shortly after the universe was born. That's completely false, but it adds to the mystery. The inn itself was given to Takoya after he won a game of chance. Since inheriting the Inn, Takoya has turned the inn around. Now, it is a tourist hotspot for all of the adventurers that find themselves in need of a place to rest. After severe remodeling, the inn is the symbol of luxury and prestige within the great city.</p>
