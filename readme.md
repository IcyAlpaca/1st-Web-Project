This is simply a webpage for a fictional character who runs a fantasy inn. The inspiration comes from a character from a game of Dungeons and Dragons that I created. The entire premise to this is to help users make reservations at the inn and to get information on all the services rendered at said inn.
I used implementations from html, css, and bootstrap.
In the future, I want to clean the page up make it look a lot smoother. I also want to add more functions such as an interactive map of the Inn itself perhaps. In addition, I want to blend the different sections of each page, to give it a more natural feel to it. 

As an aside, all the pictures I used were from doing simple Google searches. All credit to those images should go to the photographers or artists that they belong to.
